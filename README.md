# Fourier_Animation
Using Manim Package inside python to build intuative animations 
illustrating Fourier transforms singal processing

Plan:
-Frequency Matching
-Invisible rectangle window
-Hanning window and edge smoothing
-Power Spectral Density

Ultimate Goal
-Carr yout Vibraation analysis and fault detection
